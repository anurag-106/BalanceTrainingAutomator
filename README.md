# BalanceTrainingAutomator
Overview
GamesAutomator is a Python automation framework designed to facilitate the simulation and testing of software environments, particularly focusing on games and training simulations. This framework utilizes keyboard and mouse automation to interact with software, manage file and directory operations, and control software processes. The primary use case involves automating tasks within a virtual client environment for recording, playback, and training purposes in a virtual simulation or game setting.

Features
Keyboard and Mouse Automation: Simulate keyboard presses and mouse clicks to navigate and interact within the software environment.
Process Management: Start, stop, and kill software processes to prepare the environment for testing.
File and Directory Management: Manipulate files and directories, such as switching videos for training sessions or managing logs and reports.
Automated Login: Automate the login process to access the software environment.
Training Session Automation: Automate specific training sessions, including setup, execution, and teardown.
JSON Configuration: Read settings and configurations from a JSON file to customize the automation process.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
pyautogui: For simulating mouse and keyboard actions.
PIL (Python Imaging Library): For image-based actions and screenshots.
subprocess: For process management.
json: For reading JSON configuration files.
re: For regular expressions.
datetime: For managing date and time operations.
keyboard: For detecting keyboard events (used in a separate script).
